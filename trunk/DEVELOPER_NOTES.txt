Notes To Myself
---------------

001. Check when/if IsSpellKnown() is a better idea.

002. CanExitVehicle() and IsMounted()

003. Floating might be swimming with no mirror bar for breath.

004. You can know tradeskill-only mounts for tradeskills you unlearned.

005. Might be better to look for Sea Legs aura for Vashj'ir.

006. Does GetUnitSpeed return negative if you go backwards?

007. "Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest" (71086)
