Notes To Myself
---------------

* Diff since tag

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* "Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest" (71086)

    Item ID 71076.  Spell ID is 101641 (Tarecgosa's Visage)

    What do IsSpellKnown and IsUsableSpell return on the Spell ID if
    you have it equipped/not equipped?

    Can you summon the mount by casting the spell directly instead of
    using the item?  That would allow a lot of simplification but I
    doubt you can.  Testing with Hearthstone doesn't allow it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Might be better to look for Sea Legs aura for Vashj'ir.

    Seems to be working OK without it, don't worry about it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You can use flying mounts when you are floating in flyable areas.

    IsUsableSpell() returns correctly for mount spells for swimming
    vs floating.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* CanExitVehicle() and IsMounted()

    Added vehicle exit, not sure about in combat.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Flying in areas you don't know how to.

    Testing shows IsFlyableArea() works properly for you.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Does GetUnitSpeed return negative if you go backwards?

    No it doesn't.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You can know tradeskill-only mounts for tradeskills you unlearned.

    You can but IsUsableSpell seems to return false for them.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Check when/if IsSpellKnown() is a better idea.

    So far it seems identical to looping over the spellbook tab. It
    never returns true for mount spells.
