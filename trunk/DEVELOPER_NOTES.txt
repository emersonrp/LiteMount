Notes To Myself
---------------

* "Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest" (71086)

* Might be better to look for Sea Legs aura for Vashj'ir.

* You can use flying mounts when you are floating in flyable areas.
     IsUsableSpell() returns correctly for mount spells for swimming
     vs floating.

* CanExitVehicle() and IsMounted()
     Added vehicle exit, not sure about in combat.

* Flying in areas you don't know how to.
     Testing shows IsFlyableArea() works properly for you.

* Does GetUnitSpeed return negative if you go backwards?
     No it doesn't.

* You can know tradeskill-only mounts for tradeskills you unlearned.
     You can but IsUsableSpell seems to return false for them.

* Check when/if IsSpellKnown() is a better idea.
     So far it seems identical to looping over the spellbook tab. It
     never returns true for mount spells.
