Notes To Myself
---------------

008. Flying in areas you don't know how to.
     Testing shows IsFlyableArea() works properly for you.

007. "Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest" (71086)

006. Does GetUnitSpeed return negative if you go backwards?
       No it doesn't.

005. Might be better to look for Sea Legs aura for Vashj'ir.

004. You can know tradeskill-only mounts for tradeskills you unlearned.
       You can but IsUsableSpell seems to return false for them.

003. Floating might be swimming with no mirror bar for breath.

002. CanExitVehicle() and IsMounted()

001. Check when/if IsSpellKnown() is a better idea.
       So far it seems identical to looping over the spellbook tab. It
       never returns true for mount spells.
